# Spotify Console App

This is a Java console application that allows you to stream music from another computer on your network using sockets. The project was developed as a way to learn socket programming in Java.

## How it works

When you start the Spotify Console App, it will open a socket on your computer and wait for incoming connections from other computers on your network. Once connected, you can send a command to the other computer to start streaming music from their computer.

The app is named "Spotify" because it allows you to stream music from someone else's computer just like the popular music streaming service.
